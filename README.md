Sales Data Visualization


This project provides a simple Python script to analyze and visualize sales data, including revenue trends, product demand, and seasonal sales patterns using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.


- **Revenue Trend Over Time**: A line chart displaying revenue fluctuations over a period.
- **Product Demand Analysis**: A bar chart representing the total units sold for each product.
- **Seasonal Sales Trends**: A box plot showing monthly revenue distribution to identify seasonal variations.


Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gauravkkaushal/Simple-Sales-Data-Visualization_202401100400089
cd Simple-Sales-Data-Visualization_202401100400089
```
2. Run the script:
```bash
Gaurav_Kaushal_202401100400089.ipynb
```

## Sample Data Structure
The script uses a sample dataset structured as follows:
```python
{
    'Date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-02-01', ...],
    'Product': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', ...],
    'Revenue': [1200, 1500, 1800, ...],
    'Units_Sold': [100, 120, 140, ...]
}
```

Replace it with actual sales data for real analysis.

Output
- **Line plot** for revenue trends.
- **Bar chart** for product demand.
- **Box plot** for seasonal sales patterns.
